# Chr.Avro benchmarks

This directory contains applications that measure Chr.Avro’s performance. Benchmarks help identify areas where performance can be improved and prevent regressions.

So far, there’s only one application, a .NET console application that tests a number of scenarios on both Chr.Avro and the [Apache .NET implementation](https://github.com/apache/avro/tree/master/lang/csharp). Use [`dotnet run`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run) to execute it from the command line.
