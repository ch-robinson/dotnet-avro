# Chr.Avro is an Avro implementation for .NET

It’s designed to serve as a flexible alternative to the [Apache Avro implementation](https://github.com/apache/avro/tree/master/lang/csharp/src/apache/main) and integrate seamlessly with [Confluent’s Kafka and Schema Registry clients](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet).
